# Fetch the project from this repository.

1. **Find the Repository:** Open the web browser and hit the below URL to open the repository.
https://github.com/ParryPatel021/ImageLoading.git

2. **Get the Clone URL:** On the repository page, you'll see a green button labeled "Code". Click on it, and it will reveal a dropdown with a URL. Make sure it says "HTTPS" if you want to clone using HTTPS, or if you prefer to use SSH, click on "Use SSH" and copy the provided SSH URL.
Open Terminal (or Git Bash on Windows): Open your terminal or command prompt. You can usually find it in your applications or by searching for "terminal" or "command prompt" in your operating system's search bar.
Navigate to the Directory Where You Want to Clone: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. For example, if you want to clone it into your Documents folder, you might type:
```
cd Documents

```
3. **Clone the Repository:** Once you're in the right directory, use the git clone command followed by the URL https://github.com/ParryPatel021/ImageLoading.git.

If you're using HTTPS, it would look like this:
```
git clone https://github.com/ParryPatel021/ImageLoading.git

```
If you're using SSH, it would look like this:
```
git clone git@github.com:ParryPatel021/repository.git

```

4. **Enter Your GitHub Credentials (If Using HTTPS):** If you're using HTTPS and you haven't previously authenticated with GitHub on your machine, you may be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password.
Wait for the Cloning to Complete: Once you've entered the command, Git will clone the repository to your local machine. Depending on the size of the repository and your internet connection speed, this may take a few moments.

5. **Access Your Cloned Repository:** Once the cloning process is complete, you'll have a local copy of the repository in the directory you specified. You can navigate into the cloned repository.
6. **Open it into Android Studio**: Launch an Android Studio and follow below steps:
```
- Goto File -> Open -> [Select the cloned repository directory].
- Then Click on the open Button available in the directory selection window.
- Now, wait for some time until the project gets built by Android Studio.
- After successfully building, it is ready to run in the Real Device OR an Emulator.
